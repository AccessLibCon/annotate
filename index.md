__1.__ Make sure you a running a modern version of Ruby (v2 or later) and have **[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)** installed.

__2.__ Clone the **[demo site repository](https://github.com/mnyrop/bnf640)** onto your local machine and open it in a text editor like **[Atom](https://atom.io/)**.

__3.__ Serve the site locally by moving into the site directory and running
`$ bundle install && bundle exec jekyll serve`

__4.__ Add some new annotations by following **[the instructions above]({{ site.baseurl }}/#2)**.

__5.__ Continue to add or delete annotations. When you are ready, click 'view cached annotation JSON' again then download the data for each canvas.

__6.__ Clear the cached annotations from your browser storage. (In Chrome, right click > Inspect > Application > Clear Storage > Clear site data). Your annotations will be gone at this point.

__7.__ Stop the Jekyll serve command. (CTRL-C on Mac)

__8.__ Drag the downloaded JSON files into correct folder within the `annotation` annotation directory of the demo site repository. (Either `bnf640` or `haemisphaerium`. Do not put them into any subfolders.)

__9.__ Run `$ bundle exec rake`. This will store your annotations in subfolders and create a copy of the IIIF manifest that will reference them.

__10.__ Serve the site again with `$ bundle exec jekyll serve`. Your annotations will be back and permanent!

__11.__ Want to add more annotations? Follow the same process and drag new files into the `annotations` folder. This will not overwrite any existing annotation data.
